# sudoku-solver

I did this project over a couple afternoons just to satisfy my curiosity. As such, it lacks things like unit tests, performance optimizations, parameterized configuration, clean code refactoring, etc.

The program still has trouble with some of the harder sudoku puzzles, but it can solve easy and medium difficulty puzzles.

Update the value of the `PUZZLE_INPUT` string in the code to change which puzzle the program solves.
